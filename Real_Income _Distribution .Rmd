# Introduction
We adjust SILC data.

# Model

These are annual income components of households in 2018.
The weight corresponds to the survey weight of each household type.
Thus the total annual income covered in the household survey in 2018 is merely 1212 billion TL.
This is well below the disposable income derived from the national accounts; which is around 3000 billion TL

The sources of this gap are (1) the gap in property income and (2) the gap in other income sources.
Let's focus on the property income. 
The sum of property income covered in the household survey is only 41.3 billion TL.
However, the property income in OECD institutional sectors\footnote{The documentation for *OECD data* may be found at \url{https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=SNA_TABLE14A}}
data is 464 billion TL.
Thus there is a huge underreporting of top incomes.




We take the unreported income, about 422 billion TL, and distribute that income equally to the top 10 percent
of the households.
Thus each of the top 2.4 million households in the population and correspondingly 2400 households in the 
survey will increase their income by 176 thousand TL. 

With the top income adjusted dataset we calculate the gini coefficient and find that  the real gini coefficient is 0.57 rather than the official 0.41.

Next we will distribute the underreported income relying on a Pareto distribution among the top 10 income
households.
